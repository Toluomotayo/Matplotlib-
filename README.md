# Matplotlib Project: Visualizing Gas Prices and FIFA Player Statistics

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Matplotlib for data visualization, showcasing various graph types and insights using two datasets: the Gas Price Dataset and the FIFA Dataset. It was implemented using Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
Gas Price Analysis
 + Line Graph: Displayed four countries' gas price trends over different years.
 + Highlighted patterns and year-to-year variations for clear comparative insights.

FIFA Player Statistics (2018)
 + Histogram: Visualized player skill performance distribution, providing insights into skill-level variability.
 + Simple Pie Chart: Illustrated the dominant foot preferences of players (Right vs. Left).
 + Advanced Pie Chart: Analyzed weight distribution across five categories, ranging from players under 125 to over 200 lbs.
 + Boxplot: Compared the overall fitness of three football teams, highlighting team performance disparities.

## Requirements
To run this script, you need the following Python libraries:
